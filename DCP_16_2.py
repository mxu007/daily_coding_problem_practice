# Given a table of currency exchange rates, represented as a 2-D array, determine whether there is a possible arbitrage opportunity

#  Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph.[

# e.g. graph = 
# {
#     'USD': {'GBP':0.77, 'INR':71.71, 'EUR':0.87},
#     'GBP': {'USD':1.30, 'INR':93.55, 'EUR':1.14},
#     'INR': {'USD':0.014, 'GBP':0.011, 'EUR':0.012},
#     'EUR': {'USD':1.14, 'GBP':0.88, 'INR':81.95}
# }

# Find out if there is some sequence of trades you can make, starting with some amount X of any currency, so that you can end up with some amount greater than X of that currentcy

# model the currencies and exchange rates as a graph, where nodes are currencies and edges are the exchange ratess between each currencies

# we must determine if it is possible to find a cycle whose edge weight product is greater than 1
# log(ab) = log(a) + log(b)
# take log and negate, the problem becomes finding a negative sum cycle
# O(n^3) time where n is no.of currencies
