# Number of ways to clib a staircase
# There exists a staircase with n steps which you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. 
# Given n, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.

# E.g. Input, n=4, 
# Output: 5 unique ways
# 1, 1, 1, 1
# 2, 1, 1
# 1, 2, 1
# 1, 1, 2,
# 2, 2

# what if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could clibb any number from a set of positive integers X. For example, if X =1,3,5
# In the worst case the recursive tree of the algorithm has height of SS and the algorithm solves only S subproblems because it caches precalculated solutions in a table. Each subproblem is computed with nn iterations, one by coin denomination. Therefore there is O(S*n)O(Sâˆ—n) time complexity.
